# Final cs50 2025 project:
<br><br>
# A website fully automated to capture user inputs 
# and create a downloadable file using
# name and flower design.
<br><br>
# Domain name: namesprouts.com
<br><br>
# User selects a birthmonth flower and
# spells the name to be written up the
# flowers stem.

# A user must sign up, login and be given 
# a password and username to access site.

# Designs are saved and can be edited and
# finally purchased for download to print.
